- 'Click Up' game

## Project Description 
The purpose of 'Click Up' is to click on a ball in order to keep it off the ground–– very similar to how soccer players juggle a soccer ball. 

While the ball is off the ground, each click is a worth a certain amount points where the total score is displayed on a score board. 

In addition to the scoreboard, game stats will also display/update after each round:
- highest score
- longest volley

Each round ends when the ball touches the ground.
